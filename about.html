        <h1>History of Topsail Beach</h1>
        <img src="images/ashley-hunt-zxNNcCa4wS8-unsplash.jpg" class="responsive-image">
        <p>
            Situated at the southern end of Topsail Island, off the coast of southeastern North Carolina, the Town of Topsail Beach is the smallest of the three communities located on the 26-mile long island. North Topsail Beach occupies the northernmost section, and Surf City, the largest town on the island, is in the center. The Island is just off US Highway 17, about half-way between Wilmington and Jacksonville. Topsail Island has a rich and varied history.
            <br>
            Although folklore has it that the island was named Topsail (pronounced Tops'l) because pirate ships hid behind the island with their topsails visible from the sea, the name came from New Topsail Inlet.  This inlet's name can be found on early navigational charts with the other Topsail Inlet located in Beaufort, N.C. Soon after J.G. Anderson developed the southernmost end of the island and named it New Topsail Beach, the island has been called Topsail.
